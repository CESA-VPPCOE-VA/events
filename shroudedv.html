                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first round of this event "UTSAH" took place on Friday, August 11, 2023, at 11am. In this round a quiz was conducted on the history of Indian freedom warriors. 15 teams participated in this event.

The winning team names were "Brainy Bunch", "Swatantra", "1+sin theta", "Patriotic", "Team titles" and "VA group 1".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At 2 p.m., the CESA organizers and Prof. Shefali Raina held a meeting to give the winning teams instructions for the second round “SAHAS”. 
                        In this round, eligible teams were tasked with portraying India's unsung heroes. During this discussion, all of the teams agreed on one unsung hero to perform on and also discussed their costumes. The organizers also provided rehearsal dates so that participants could practice before the performance.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Round 2:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The second round “SAHAS”, was held on the premises of Vasantdada Patil Pratishthan's faculty of Engineering and Visual Arts on 15th August at 10.00 a.m. Watan ke hire played the Chaphekar brothers, Jai hind ki sena played the character of Vikram Bhatra, Acp Ashok was played by the team Kesari, Udam Singh was played by the team Jag Jeeteya, Sundarlal bahugun was played by the team Bhartiya, and Kittur ki Rani Chennemma was played by Bharat ki Betiya. All of the college dignitaries and chief guests were present to see the performance. The performance was fantastic. The audience applauded for the teams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After all of the teams performed their acts, the results were announced by Ms. Neeta Vanage, Dept of Humanities & Basic Science based on their excellent performance, and four teams were shortlisted for the third round. The four teams chosen for their outstanding performance were "Bharat ki betiya", "Jay hind ki sena", "Kesari" and "Jag jeeteya".
                    </p>
                    <h3>Round 3:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The third round of "Dhairya" was a test of adaptability and innovative thinking. It was conducted in a seminar hall, where the organizers had thoroughly planned the setup for this round. Cell phones were provided so that the teams could view the questions given to them. There were three sub-rounds in round 3.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each team was given two questions for the first round. If they answered correctly, they received 10 points, otherwise zero. The time restriction for answering the provided question was 45 seconds. The second round was a buzzer round, in which the person who clicks the buzzer on their mobile device first, gets to answer the question. Once the buzzer clicked, they had only 15 seconds to answer the question. And if the response is correct, they receive 10 points; otherwise, 5 points were deducted from their overall score. The third round was similar to the first. This “Dhairya” round was won by the teams with the highest score. "Jag Jeeteya" and "Jai Hind ki Sena" were the winning teams.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Final Round "SAFALTA":</h3>
                    <p>
                        The final "SAFALTA" round was a debate round in which qualified teams were given the topic of the caste system. The two teams presented their points of view on their respective topics, and the better team, "Jag Jeeteya" won. Appasaheb Desai congratulated the “Jag Jeeteya” team and presented them with medals and certificates. He also appreciated the Cesa team for organizing the event and encouraged them to arrange more events. The head of the computer department, Rais Mulla, also congratulated the Cesa team on a successful occasion. The event was effectively carried out in this manner.
